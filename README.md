# Not2D
Not2D is NotTiled 2D game framework that you can use to create games without programming.
All you have to do is drawing tiles in NotTiled, and use properties for game logic.
Of course you will also need your game assets (such as sprites, textures, and sounds).

Not2D is still under development. Current features:
1. Create 2D Games without coding
2. Support logic for game progression
3. Physics engine
4. Support HID controller and touch analog

Development roadmap:
1. Text dialogs
2. Multiplayer Support
3. Clear documentation

How to develop your game:
1. Open the code in Android studio, and replace the files inside the assets folder.
2. The code includes a sample game (a clone of an old 2d game), you can use the samples for reference. As it is right now, documentation is minimal.
3. Compile and enjoy.

What if you have no PC?
